# Cosmetology VR by Kristin Dragos

## About

This project was designed for the Udacity's VR Developer Nanodegree program. The goal is to do research on an industry that seems unconvnentional and determined if and how virtual reality has impacted it. 

While I was in college, I was a cosmetologist, so I chose the beauty industry. I wasn't surprised to find a number of virtual makeover tools as I had seen early versions years ago. However, I was surprised to find out that L'Oreal is working on a virtual reality training program for cosmetologists and that Sally Hansen developed an app that will scan your hand for skin tones and match you up with nail polish colors that pair well with your skin tone.

## Enhancements

My ideas for enhancing this game include:

A waypoint system for navigating around the scene. 
Audio and a UI canvas for waypoints that activate based on proximity.
Some custom models I made in Blender to match the salon environment. 

Challenges and Reflection

My biggest challenge was creating some of the assets. Creating the shampoo bowls for example, took me several tries. 

I am really proud of my models, and my waypoint system. I love the changing materials based on hover states.
